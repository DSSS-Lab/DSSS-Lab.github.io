					<h1>Activities in the Lab.</h1>
					<p>
					In this lab., the members are required to give their presentations which include current progress and problems they are facing once a week.
In addition, undergraduate students have to read a book which is related to our research topic such as AOP, SE, and Programming Language
and give a presentation which explains the content of one chapter by rotate manner.
In other time, we are free , however, people who has the free bare its responsibilities. Therefore, we recommend for students to come to Lab. as much as possible.
We accept any subjects which are related to software such as distributed system, programming language, software engineering, network, embedded system.
